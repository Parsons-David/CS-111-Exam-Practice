### Puporse

This site isn't meant to be a more comprehensive and effective answer to a question I get every semester as a Rutgers University CS 111 TA.

How can I study for the exam?

Oringinally I created [this](docs/CS 111 Fall 2016 Binary, Truth Table, and Conditional Practice.pdf), as an answer to that question.

But now that I have the "web skills" required to write an easily accesible Webpage for students to use instead, I created this.

### Tech

JavaScript & HTML

I might add some Bootstrap flair later on.
