### Puporse

This site is meant to be a more comprehensive and effective answer to a question I get every semester as a Rutgers University CS 111 TA.

How can I study for the exam?

Oringinally I created [this](/docs/CS%20111%20Fall%202016%20Binary%2C%20Truth%20Table%2C%20and%20Conditional%20Practice.pdf), as an answer to that question.

But now that I have the "web skills" required to write an easily accesible Webpage for students to use instead, I created this.
